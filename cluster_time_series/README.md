# Cluster Time Series Analysis

This experiment aims to analyze time series data for specific clusters, tracking how the absolute numbers and proportions of different clusters change over time (monthly).

## Objectives
- Track monthly changes in cluster populations
- Analyze the ratio changes between different clusters
- Identify trends and patterns in cluster distributions over time

## Directory Structure
- `/query/query`: SQL queries for extracting time series data
- `/query/query_result`: Results from the SQL queries
- `/analysis/source_code`: Python code for analyzing the time series data
- `/analysis/report`: Analysis reports and visualizations

## Methods
The analysis will focus on tracking how clusters like the ones identified in previous experiments (e.g., jackpot-seekers with high churn rates of 95.5%) evolve over time.
